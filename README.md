# Robby Roto Disassembly (coin-op arcade game)

This disassembly was originally done by Richard Degler, and it's a great resource for understanding the inner workings of the Astrocade platform.

Sadly Richard passed away back in 2020 and in one of the last emails he sent was this disassembly. I have made sure it compiles correctly and the binaries run with the correct checksums.

Here are some details about the code from an Email from Richard:

This README.md file will be updated with more details later.
